If this is your first time here, welcome!
As this starts as a project for a class in Software Design, my hope for this website is to be a place for me to put many of my thoughts and professional development as I learn more and more about the web and the development behind it.

As I learn to do more things and track my courses over the semester into my professional development, my plan is to keep these pages updated with things I've been learning.
